look secrets
also C:\mandrake botta\funstuff or whatever path you placed it and look cocielofun.py and look the secret and replace with actual, btw this one cocielofun.py does not work
also finally the thing:delete the ==version and keep their names on requirements.txt
and also javac -cp ".;json-20220924.jar" ImageEngine.java to compile in tools and then run java -cp ".;json-20220924.jar" ImageEngine
